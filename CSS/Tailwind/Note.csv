Base: 
Base styles are the default styles applied to HTML elements. These styles provide a consistent look across your site and usually target bare HTML elements (like h1, p, a, ul, etc.).

Component: 
Component styles are for specific reusable UI blocks. These can be buttons, cards, navbars, modals, etc.

Utility:
Utility classes are single-purpose classes that do one thing only (e.g., set margin, padding, color).
